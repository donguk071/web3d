# To Do

You guys are supposed to do the following:
- Set up your GIT and Be ready for the contributor of "https://github.com/korfriend/web3d.git"
- Make your working folder (e.g, your account name) under this folder (you can use your own branches but the final "push" must be the master branch)
- Using the skeleton codes, which prof.Kim provided, complete the codes to satisfy the bellow specification

### Specification:
- Replace the camera controls provided by the OrbitControl module with your own control codes
- Use the mouse event via JavaScript event callbacks (refer to the skeleton code)
- Camera translating along the viewing direction (zooming effect in the perspective mode), panning, rotating

### Progress
